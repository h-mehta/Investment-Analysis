## Investment Analysis
 
Objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.

Goals of data analysis: Divided into three sub-goals:

1. Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that we can choose the type that is best suited for us ( As per constraints - English speaking country and amount per investment round should be between 5-15 million USD).

2. Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be our favourites as well.

3. Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.
